to refresh your memory about the instructions,
1. description: mentioning topics , what is the text talks about, names, things, locations mentioned so "chat" can be searchable by keywords, or similarity and synonyms
2. reactions: if user felt something , how he felt , keep it bank if user didn't felt anything 
3. information: profiling information about user , things that you (assistant) want to remember for future about user, like names, families , personal thoughts, locations , time, reminders, date , what user likes , dislikes , interested in , doing , past histories, include info that is maybe subtle , but has good informational value for you 
4. chat_flow: what user started with then what you (assistant) said then what user went about so on and so on, but in a compact format 
5. tags: the topics name , noun, verb. tags can have multiple synonyms for future search ability, DO NOT ADD RANDOM "tags"
